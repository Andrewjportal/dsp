[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The CDF of 1000 values generated by random.random forms a straight diagonal line going up from the left to right. Since all numbers have the same propabality, we expect a linear relationship between a numberline of values and the percentage of distribution.

the PMF of 1000 values generated by random.random froms a rectangle of uniform height and width.The x-axis values with the distribution all have the same y-axis proability in a PMF graph.
